# Introduction

Welcome to the Mantle Estate documentation!

Mantle Estate is a decentralized platform for trading synthetic real estate. You can open long or short positions on real estate markets of various cities around the world.

## Core Concepts

- **Index Price** — The trading price that accounts for the imbalance of open positions (skew)
- **Funding Rate** — The funding rate that is paid or received depending on position imbalance
- **Positions** — Open long or short positions on real estate markets
- **Market Metrics** — Market metrics: open interest, trading volume, position imbalance
